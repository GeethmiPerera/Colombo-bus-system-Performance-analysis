#  Colombo Bus System â€“ Performance Modeling and Evaluation

## Overview
This repository contains the submission for **Deliverable 01** of the Performance Modeling and Evaluation assignment.

The chosen system is the **Colombo Bus Transport System**, which operates across the Western Province of Sri Lanka.  
The system includes multiple stakeholders such as the **National Transport Commission (NTC)**, **private and public bus operators**, **passengers**, and **traffic authorities**.

##  1. High-Level Problem Description
The Colombo bus network experiences major performance challenges:
- Long passenger **waiting times**.
- **Irregular schedules** due to variable traffic conditions.
- **Inefficient bus utilization**, resulting in crowding or empty runs.
- **Reduced reliability** and passenger satisfaction.

To analyze and address these issues, a simulation-based performance model is proposed using real-world patterns represented through **synthetic data**.
