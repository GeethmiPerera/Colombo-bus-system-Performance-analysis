# Colombo Bus System Performance Modeling Project

##  Project Overview
A comprehensive performance modeling and evaluation of the Colombo Public Bus Transportation Network using discrete-event simulation and data analytics. This project analyzes real bus operational data to identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation, and improve service reliability.

##  Project Objectives
*   **Performance Analysis**: Evaluate current bus system performance using historical data
*   **Bottleneck Identification**: Identify routes and time periods with significant delays
*   **Resource Optimization**: Propose data-driven optimization strategies
*   **Simulation Modeling**: Create a discrete-event simulation to test "what-if" scenarios
*   **Visualization**: Generate insightful charts and graphs for performance metrics
